# REST API vs GraphQL API: A Concise Comparison

## REST API:

- **Resource-Based:** REST APIs are built around resources, each identified by a URL, with actions represented by HTTP methods.
- **Stateless Operations:** Requests must contain all necessary information; the server does not store client context between requests.
- **Fixed Data Structure:** Server responses follow a fixed structure; clients cannot specify required data precisely, leading to potential over-fetching or under-fetching.
- **Versioning:** Changes are managed through versioning, often leading to maintenance of multiple API versions.

## GraphQL API:

- **Query Language for API:** GraphQL describes the API's data comprehensively, enabling clients to request precisely what they need for efficiency.
- **Single Endpoint:** Operates over a single endpoint, with clients using queries for data retrieval and mutations for data modification.
- **Real-Time Data:** Supports real-time updates via subscriptions, allowing clients to maintain live connections for immediate data updates.
- **Introspective:** Self-documenting schema defines API capabilities, facilitating tooling support like auto-completion and validation.
- **Avoid Over and Under Fetching:** Clients specify exact data needs, mitigating issues of over-fetching and under-fetching.

## Additional Tools and Concepts:

- **Installation: Apollo Client**

  - **Apollo Client:** A full-fledged GraphQL client that seamlessly integrates with frontend frameworks, providing features like caching and error handling.

- **Development Environment: GraphiQL**

  - **GraphiQL:** In-browser IDE for interactive exploration of GraphQL APIs, facilitating query testing and documentation viewing.

- **GraphQL Operations:**

  - **Query:** Corresponds to HTTP GET method, used for data retrieval.
    - Example:
      ```graphql
      query {
        getUser(id: "123") {
          id
          name
          email
        }
      }
      ```
  - **Mutation:** Similar to HTTP POST, used for modifying data, often involving updating UI with readQuery and writeQuery.
    - Example:
      ```graphql
      mutation {
        updateUser(id: "123", input: { name: "New Name", email: "new@email.com" }) {
          id
          name
          email
        }
      }
      ```
  - **Optimistic Response:** Allows optimistic UI updates by providing a temporary response before receiving confirmation from the server.
    - Example:
      ```json
      {
        "id": "temp-id-123",
        "title": "New Todo",
        "completed": false
      }
      ```
  - **Fragment:** Enables the construction and reuse of field sets within queries for improved query structure.
    - Example:
      ```graphql
      fragment UserInfo on User {
        id
        name
        email
      }
      ```
  - **Directives:** Allows dynamic query structure changes based on variables, addressing scenarios like summarized vs. detailed views.
    - Example:
      ```graphql
      query ($detailed: Boolean!) {
        getUser(id: "123") {
          id
          name
          ... @include(if: $detailed) {
            email
            phone
          }
        }
      }
      ```
  - **Meta Fields:** Offers additional metadata like \_\_typename for insights into query execution.
    - Example:
      ```graphql
      query {
        __typename
        getUser(id: "123") {
          id
          name
        }
      }
      ```

- GraphQL services may implement batching techniques or use tools like DataLoader to optimize database access.
- Additional tools like GraphQL Shield for authorization and GraphQL ESLint for code quality assurance may enhance GraphQL API development.
